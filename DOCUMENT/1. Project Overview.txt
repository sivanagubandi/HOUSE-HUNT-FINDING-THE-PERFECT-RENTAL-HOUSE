2. User Roles & Stories
Roles:
Renter: Searches via filters, favorites listings, fills out applications, chats with landlords, books viewings.

Landlord: Creates property listings (photos, details, rent), manages availability and inquiries, schedules viewings.

Admin: Oversees users, moderates content, handles dispute resolution.

Example User Stories:
“As a renter, I can search by location, price, bedrooms, and amenities.”

“As a landlord, I can upload property details and manage booking calendar.”

“As a renter, I can save favorite listings and compare them side by side.”
